# Weather-app-using-Rapid-API

### Project Description: Weather Application

The Weather Application is a user-friendly web-based tool designed to provide real-time weather information using HTML, CSS, and pure vanilla JavaScript. This application fetches weather data from the RapidAPI Weather API and displays it in a clear and accessible format. Key features of the application include:

- Real-Time Weather Data: Users can access current weather information, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and other relevant parameters.
- API Integration: The application leverages RapidAPI's Weather API to fetch accurate and up-to-date weather data for various locations.
- Responsive Design: Using HTML and CSS, the application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a consistent user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
- Dynamic Updates: JavaScript is used to dynamically update the weather information based on the user's input or selected location.

This project highlights the effective use of fundamental web technologies to create a practical and informative weather application, providing users with essential weather updates in real-time.
